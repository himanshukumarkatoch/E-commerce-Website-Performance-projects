🛒 E-commerce Website Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project
A dynamic Power BI dashboard project that analyzes customer behavior, order performance, traffic sources, and return rates for an e-commerce business.

📌 Project Overview
This dashboard provides deep insights into how an e-commerce website is performing by analyzing customer segments, order trends, revenue, and return patterns. The goal is to help stakeholders understand:

What is the total revenue generated from all completed orders?
What is the distribution of customer segments (New, Returning, VIP) in the dataset?
How many orders were placed from each website traffic source (Organic, Paid Ads, Referral, Direct)?
What is the average session duration for users who completed their purchases?
How many orders were returned, and what percentage of total orders does this represent?
